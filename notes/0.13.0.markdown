# 0.13.0

This version refactors the whole data release process:

* `aws-scala-tools` was removed and `s3` and `files` were added as new dependencies.
* The release process is now local: no EC2 instances are run when releasing a new version of the package.
* The release process was refactored out of tests and reimplemented in an object on the main code.
* The definition of the data was slightly improved.
* The old data versions were removed from the code and the current test versions are being uploaded to an `unstable` subdirectory in S3.
* A new test was implemented to check that all supported versions are in S3 as expected.

From now on, the data release process should look something like the following:

1. Add a new `object` that extends `Version` in [`src/main/scala/data.scala`](https://github.com/ohnosequences/db.rnacentral/blob/releases.0.13.0/src/main/scala/data.scala); e.g., `case object _11_0 extends Version("11.0")`
2. Perform the mirror through the method [`release.mirrorNewVersion`](https://github.com/ohnosequences/db.rnacentral/blob/releases.0.13.0/src/main/scala/release.scala#L131-L137); e.g., through an `sbt console`:
```scala
scala> import ohnosequences.db.rnacentral._
scala> release.mirrorNewVersion(Version._10_0, new java.io.File("~/localDir"))
```
3. Prepare a new release of the repository by writing release notes in the corresponding file in [`notes`](https://github.com/ohnosequences/db.rnacentral/tree/releases.0.13.0/notes); e.g. in `notes/0.14.0.markdown`
4. Make the release of the repository, that checks that all declared versions of the data exist and are correct. This is done through the `sbt` `release` task; e.g., with `sbt release minor`
