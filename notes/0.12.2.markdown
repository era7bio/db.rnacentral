# 0.12.2

Up to RNACentral v7, the sequences and ID mappings files were aligned. From v8, the ID mappings file is no longer ordered.

This release fixes the issues caused by this change, modifying the code to take this into account and removing the tests that checked that the files were actually aligned.

However, this fix has increased both the time and the memory needed to run the `ReleaseOnly` tests, as the whole ID mappings is now stored in-memory as a map linking the RNA IDs with the annotations.
