* Removed table pre-filtering; mirroring just uncompresses the data and uploads it to S3
* Renamed id2taxa* things to table* (they contain all columns)
* Rewrote BlastDB generation code to use multiple id-taxa mapping
* Removed grouping; chose an instance with a lot of memory
* Fixed GenerateBlastDB bundle deps, made processSources non-final
* Changed artifact name and added artifact version to the output S3 location
